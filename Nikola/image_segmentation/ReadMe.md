# Stations Dataset

Stations Dataset was found at: https://cpcb.nic.in/nwmp-monitoring-network/

This folder contains code to visually represent the water quality predictions on the map of India using 5px x 5px squares with color coding:

- very good: green
- good: blue
- bad: orange
- very bad: red

There is a small offset due to the curves on the planet, which can be fixed, but in this case is not.

To be able to do this, we first added the longitude and latitude to each station in the predicted dataset  using code_stations_processing notebook.

Once that is done, we can feed the output/dataset with coordinates into the full_segmentation notebook that will result in an image.
